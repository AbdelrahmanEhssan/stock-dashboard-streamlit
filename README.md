# Stock Market Dashboard (Streamlit)

An interactive stock visualization dashboard built using Python and Streamlit.
This project fetches historical stock data, computes moving averages, and visualizes trends to explore market behavior.

It was developed as part of my self-study journey into data science, machine learning, and AI systems engineering.

## Project Overview

This dashboard allows users to:

* Download real stock data using the Yahoo Finance API
* Compare multiple stocks (e.g., AAPL vs MSFT)
* Visualize price trends over time
* Compute moving averages to smooth market noise

The project demonstrates practical skills in data processing, visualization, and building lightweight web apps in Python.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – data processing & feature engineering
* **yfinance** – financial data API
* **Streamlit** – interactive dashboard UI

---

## Run Locally

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdelrahmanEhssan/stock-dashboard-streamlit/
cd stock-dashboard-streamlit
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The dashboard will open in your browser.

## What I Learned

Through this project I practiced:

* Building end-to-end data workflows
* Translating raw data into visual insights
* Designing simple user-facing tools with Python
* Organizing projects for GitHub portfolios

This is part of my broader path toward building production-ready AI systems and data applications.
